# Custom Services - Sample Object

Welcome to our new CAP project. This is the backend connected to our Hana DB where the generated frontend on SSv2 stores its data.

It contains these folders and files, following our recommended project layout:

File or Folder | Purpose
---------|----------
`app/` | content for UI frontends goes here
`db/` | your domain models and data go here
`srv/` | your service models and code go here
`package.json` | project metadata and configuration
`readme.md` | this getting started guide
